<h4>Background</h4>

I currently work as a Data Analyst at the [National marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/) and independent contractor. How did I get here? My journey in environmental data began at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I earned a **B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology** and a **B.A. in Environmental Studies**. I held research technician positions studying human impacts on aquatic insect and microbial communities across California, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.

I later moved to Mammoth Lakes, CA, to work as a Freshwater Ecologist at the [Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Center (SNARL)](https://vesr.nrs.ucsb.edu/about), where I researched the long term ecological impacts of mining pollution on alpine stream ecosystems. This was in effort to monitor post-remediation success according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Superfund.

In 2022, I pursued a Master’s in Environmental Science and Management at the [Bren School](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara with a focus in Data Science. My goal was to learn more technical skills so that I could use them to guide and inform environmental policy. During this time, I served as a data manager on a project for NOAA modeling riparian habitat restoration costs and worked and interned with the Nature Conservancy studying potential invasive species on the Channel Islands. These experiences built the foundation for the career I’m lucky to have today.

<h4>Projects</h4>

**Current**

I work collaboratively with a team of economists at NOAA’s [Northwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center), a division of NOAA Fisheries, to conduct policy relevant analyses that support the sustainable management of commercial fisheries under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). My work involves building robust data pipelines in R and SQL, developing machine learning models, and creating interactive dashboards to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. These tools and analyses are designed to inform fisheries policy and management decisions at the federal level. I also prepare technical reports and publish interactive tools to ensure that stakeholders, including policymakers, scientists, and the public, can engage with the data and understand how fisheries are evolving in response to ecological and regulatory changes.

I work part time doing data related contracts as well, so feel free to reach out if you have work in mind you would like assistance with. Recently, I built a Shiny application for [Comunidad y Biodiversidad](https://cobi.org.mx/en/), a Mexican non-profit that supports small scale fisheries. The app serves as an evaluation tool that enables users to assess the effectiveness of marine protected area across Mexico. Check it out [here](https://innovacionazul.shinyapps.io/fish_refuge_app/).

On the side, I work for a small yoga studio called Yoga Soup performing a variety of data analytics and management tasks to help the company grow, save subscription costs, and maintain a healthy understanding of business performance.

**Previous**

As the Data Manager for my master’s capstone project at UCSB in partnership with NOAA, I led the development of spatial and economic models to inform salmon habitat restoration planning in Washington State. Using R and ArcGIS, I integrated diverse vector and raster datasets—including land use, hydrology, and watershed characteristics—to estimate restoration costs and assess ecological benefits. I oversaw the project’s analytical pipeline and GitHub repository, ensuring reproducibility and team coordination. To support strategic decision making and communication, I built an interactive R Shiny dashboard to effectively share our findings to NOAA restoration managers which you can see [here](https://ramhunte.shinyapps.io/noaa_shiny/).


During my internship with [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/), I designed and led a field based research project to evaluate how invasive rodent species respond to native predators on the Channel Islands to help inform biosecurity protocols and conservation strategies. I managed field logistics, statistical modeling, data visualization, and mentorship of an undergraduate team member. Our findings revealed key vulnerabilities in existing biosecurity protocols and provided actionable recommendations to TNC management. I presented our results at the California Islands Symposium and the Point Conception Institute Symposium, contributing to ongoing regional habitat conservation efforts.

<h4>In my free time</h4>

While much of my life passion lies in working with data, I enjoy getting outside equally as much. Some of my favorite activities include: rock climbing, surfing, paragliding, spearfishing, running, and practicing yoga.
