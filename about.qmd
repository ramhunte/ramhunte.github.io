My favorite part about my work is helping clients bring their data to life. I do this through automating data processing scripts, developing interactive R Shiny dashboards, performing spatial/statistical analyses, and generating aesthetic reports and visualizations using Quarto. I really enjoy sharing the R skills I've learned along my journey (see my Blog posts) to help others grow. I provide R workshops as a service to clients who are interested in deepening their teams' technical skills. With over 2 years of experience teaching college coursework, teaching is something I truly love doing. Reach out to me if you are in a rut with a data problem or want to upskill your team!

My journey in environmental data began at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I studied freshwater insect communities across California and Puerto Rico. Desipite my love for fieldwork, I quickly gravitated to running statistics and working with the data in R. I wanted to dive deeper into these skills, so I continued my pursuit of knowledge at the [Bren School](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara where I earned a **Master’s in Environmental Science and Management** with a focus in Data Science. Extensive technical coursework and project experience with NOAA and TNC showed me really how vast and exciting the world of data science really is. Today, I work as a contract Data Analyst at [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/) and freelance data scientist where I get to exercise my passion for data every day and share it with others.

While much of my life passion lies in working with data, I enjoy getting outside equally as much. Some of my favorite activities include: rock climbing, surfing, paragliding, spearfishing, running, and practicing yoga.
