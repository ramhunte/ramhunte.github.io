## Background

Land based meat production poses serious environmental challenges through its contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as harsh land use impacts. As society progresses further into uncharted waters with climate change, it is critical that we explore alternative options to mitigate GHG emissions. Marine aquaculture is an important practice that has a high potential to transform the way the global food supply operates as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production.[^1] One important study by [Gentry et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9) mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth .[^2] This highlighted the true potential of the industry, although it is still far from reaching its capacity.

## Objectives

The purpose of this work flow is to utilize spatial analysis tools to understand how we can identify commercial potential of natural resources. In this analysis, I am looking at how to identify potential marine species habitat suitable for aquaculture along the West Coast of the United States in each of its Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). I specifically look at habitat requirements across temperature and depth requirements for oysters (a widely commercially available food source) and then create a function from this analysis that can be applied to any west coast species with a given temperature and depth range and potential for aquaculture. This analysis utilizes a variety of spatial analysis tools to for both vector and raster data. These include:

-   spatial subsetting and joins
-   raster reclassifiaction
-   rasterization and vectorization of spatial data
-   cropping and masking layers
-   zonal statistics
-   transforming CRS
-   utilizing periodic checks

## Approach

Based on previous research, we know that oysters need the following conditions in order to reach optimal growth rates: - sea surface temperature: 11-30Â°C - depth: 0-70 meters below sea level

I used raster and vector data and spatial analysis tools to identify where these ranges overlapped to isolate suitable habitat. Following these steps, I created maps visualizing priority EEZ's depending on their total and percent suitable aquaculture habitat. I applied this methodology into a function that reproduces the same workflow to find suitable habita for any species with a temperature and depth range that could be potentially grown along the west coast.

### Data

#### Sea Surface Temperature

Average annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years 2008 to 2012 was used to characterize the average sea surface temperature within the region. The data was originally generated from [NOAA's 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php).

#### Bathymetry

To characterize the depth of the ocean I used the [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area).[^3]

[^3]: GEBCO Compilation Group (2022) GEBCO_2022 Grid (<doi:10.5285/e0f0bb80-ab44-2739-e053-6c86abc0289c>).

#### Exclusive Economic Zones

Maritime boundaries were designated using Exclusive Economic Zones off of the west coast of US from [Marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php).

## Analysis

```{r setup, include=TRUE}

```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
data <- file.path("/Users/rayhunter/Documents/Bren/Past_Courses/EDS_223/assignments/assignment-4-ramhunte/data")
```

#### Prepare data

To start, I loaded in and organized all necessary data and made sure it had the correct coordinate reference system. This involved:

-   reading in the shapefile for the West Coast EEZ (`wc_regions_clean.shp`)\
-   reading in SST raster data
    -   `average_annual_sst_2008.tif`\
    -   `average_annual_sst_2009.tif`\
    -   `average_annual_sst_2010.tif`\
    -   `average_annual_sst_2011.tif`\
    -   `average_annual_sst_2012.tif`\
-   combining SST rasters into a raster stack
-   reading in bathymetry raster (`depth.tif`)\
-   checking that data are in the same coordinate reference system\

```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, messages=FALSE, results = FALSE}
#loading in and preparing the data in raster format 

# reading in west coast eez shape file 
eez <- st_read(file.path(data, "wc_regions_clean.shp"))

#read in SST raster data as a stack
stack <- rast(c(file.path(data, "average_annual_sst_2008.tif"), 
                file.path(data, "average_annual_sst_2009.tif"), 
                file.path(data, "average_annual_sst_2010.tif"), 
                file.path(data, "average_annual_sst_2011.tif"), 
                file.path(data, "average_annual_sst_2012.tif")))

#changing CRS
stack <- project(stack, "epsg:4326")

#read in bathymetry data 
bath <- rast(file.path(data, "depth.tif"))

# plot(stack)
# plot(bath)
```

#### Process data

Next, I processed the SST and depth data so that they could be combined. In this case the SST and depth data had slightly different resolutions, extents, and positions. Because I didn't want to change the underlying depth data, I resampled to match the SST data using the nearest neighbor approach.

The steps I took can be summarized as follows:

-   Step 1: find the mean SST from 2008-2012\
-   Step 2: convert SST data from Kelvin to Celsius\
-   Step 3: crop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster (match CRS first)
-   Step 4: resample the NPP data to match the resolution of the SST datausing the nearest neighbor approach\
-   Step 5: check that the depth and SST match in resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system\

I then created a check to ensure that the extent, resolution, and CRS of bathymetry and temperature raster layers matched.

```{r processing data, results = TRUE}
# finding mean temperature raster data in celsius and aligning resolutions and extents of rasters

#findig mean of sst rasters
mean_sst <- mean(stack)
# plot(mean_sst)

#finding temp in celsius
cels_sst <- mean_sst - 273.15

#cropping depth raster to sst
crop_bath <- crop(bath, cels_sst)
# plot(crop_bath)

#resampling bath layer to match resolution of celsius
resamp_bath <- resample(crop_bath, cels_sst, method = "near")

# plot(reclass_bath)

                  ####### creating a check #######
cat("Extent, resolution, and CRS of bathymetry and temprature raster layers match:")

if(ext(resamp_bath) == ext(cels_sst) & 
   st_crs(resamp_bath)$epsg == st_crs(cels_sst)$epsg &
   # resolution has more than one responses, so we need to make sure that both are true 
   all(res(resamp_bath) == res(cels_sst))) {
  cat("TRUE")
} else{
  cat("FALSE")
}

```

#### Finding suitable locations

In order to find suitable locations for marine aquaculture, I first needed to find locations that were suitable in terms of both SST and depth. This involved reclassifying the SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for Oysters by assigning a `1` or a `NA` value to suitable and unsuitable habitats. I then multiplied the two rasters to look for locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions (raster cells where `1` values overlapped) using the `lapp()` function. Lastly, I created a check to ensure that the masked ideal layer only showed overlapping ideal depth and temperature conditions.

```{r, include=TRUE, results = TRUE}
#reclassifying temperature and bathymetry raster data, and then overlaying the layers to find ideal habitat 


# reclassify temp raster to NA or 1 if in 11-30C temp range 
rcl_temp <- classify(cels_sst, rcl = 
                      matrix(c(-Inf, 11, NA, 
                      11, 30, 1, 
                      30, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
# plot(rcl_temp)

# reclassify bathymetry data (0-70 meters below sea level)
rcl_bath <- classify(resamp_bath, rcl = 
                      matrix(c(-Inf, -70, NA, 
                      -70, 0, 1, 
                      0, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
# plot(rcl_bath)

#creating a raster stack
ideal_stack <- c(rcl_temp, rcl_bath)

#renaming rasters in stack
names(ideal_stack) <- c("temperature", "depth")

#creating a multiplication function 
multiply <- function(x,y){
  return(x*y)
}

# multiplying layers to get just cells = 1 (ideal depth and temp )
ideal_layer <- lapp(ideal_stack[[c(1,2)]], fun = multiply)

# plot(ideal_layer)

              ################### Check ###############
#checking to make sure ideal layer is only showing areas where the temp and depth are in ideal range
cat("Masked ideal layer only shows overlapping ideal depth and temperature conditons:")
if(all(
  values(ideal_layer == 1) == values(ideal_stack[[1]] == 1),
  values(ideal_layer == 1) == values(ideal_stack[[2]] == 1), na.rm = TRUE)) {
  cat("TRUE")
} else{
  cat("FALSE")
}

```

#### Determine the most suitable EEZ

I first needed to determine the total suitable area within each EEZ in order to rank zones by priority. To do so, I found the total area of suitable locations within each EEZ. The steps in which I approached this can be summarized as such:

-   Step 1: read in, rasterize, and crop the the eez data to the extent and resolution of the ideal habitat layer
-   Step 2: calculate the size of each raster cell in km\^2
-   Step 3: sum the tala area of suitable habitat cells using `zonal()` function
-   Step 4: join this data with the eez data and create new columns with the total eez area, the toal suitable habitat in each eez, and the percent suitable habitat by eez

```{r include=TRUE}
#here we are calculating the total area of suitable habitat and the percent area of suitable habitat for each EEZ

#read in EEZ data 
eez <- st_read(file.path(data, "wc_regions_clean.shp"))

#rasterizing polygon data with ideal locations by region and masking it to ideal locations
eez_mask <- rasterize(eez, ideal_layer, field = "rgn") %>% 
  terra::crop(ideal_layer, mask = TRUE)
# plot(eez_mask)

#find area of raster cells 
cell_area <- cellSize(eez_mask, unit = "km")
# plot(cell_area)

#calculate the total area of km2 by region
ideal_area <- zonal(cell_area, eez_mask, fun = "sum", na.rm = TRUE)

#joining ideal area data w/ eez vector data 
joined_eez <- left_join(eez, 
            ideal_area, 
            by = "rgn") %>% 
  mutate(ideal_area_km2 = area, 
         perc_ideal = (ideal_area_km2/area_km2)*100, 
         .before = geometry)

```

#### Visualize results

Finally, I created two maps showing 1) the total suitable oyster aquaculture habitat area by region, and 2) the percent suitable oyster aquaculture habitat area by region:

```{r, include=TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="**Figure 1. % Suitable Oyster Aquaculture Habitat of \nWest Coast Exclusive Economic Zones in the US**. Shows the percent of ideal oyster aquaculture habitat by exclusive economic zones along the west coast. Washington shows the highest % suitable habitat, followed by Central and Southern California."}

# pulling in states/base map layer for mapping EEZ's
states <- us_states

#choosing just the west coast regions
west_coast <- st_sf(us_states) %>% 
  filter(REGION == "West") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = st_crs(joined_eez))

```

#### Expanding to other species

After having identified the potential suitable habitat for oyster aquaculture, I wanted to expand this workflow to easily make maps for other species requirements. I created a function that can accept any species name, temperature, and depth ranges, and it will create two replicated maps for the given species.

```{r}
#creating a function that shows the ideal species habitat using species name,  temperature, and depth as inputs 
ideal_crib_for_a_species <- function(species = "NAME", depth_min, depth_max, temp_min, temp_max) {
# depth reclassification
  rcl_depth <- classify(resamp_bath, rcl = matrix(c(-Inf, depth_min, NA, 
                                  depth_min, depth_max, 1, 
                                  depth_max, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
#temp reclassification
  rcl_temp <- classify(cels_sst, rcl = matrix(c(-Inf, temp_min, NA, 
                                temp_min, temp_max, 1, 
                                temp_max, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
  #ideal layers stack
  ideal_stack <- c(rcl_temp, rcl_bath)
  #ideal layer
  ideal_layer <- lapp(ideal_stack[[c(1,2)]], fun = multiply)
  #rasterize eez polygons
  eez_mask <- rasterize(eez, ideal_layer, field = "rgn") %>% 
    terra::crop(ideal_layer, mask = TRUE)
  #find area of raster cells 
  cell_area <- cellSize(eez_mask, unit = "km")
  #calculate the total area of km2 by region
  ideal_area <- zonal(cell_area, eez_mask, fun = "sum", na.rm = TRUE)
  #joining ideal area data w/ eez vector data 
  joined_eez <- left_join(eez, ideal_area, by = "rgn") %>% 
    mutate(ideal_area_km2 = area, perc_ideal = (ideal_area_km2/area_km2)*100, .before = geometry)

  return(list(m1, m2))
  
  }
```

I wanted to test out this function on kelp crabs (*Pugettia producta*) as they are widely dispersed and could potentially make a good candidate for aquaculture. Data on the Kelp Crab was obtained from [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php) which presents habitat information on thousands of species. Lets take a look:

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
ideal_crib_for_a_species("Kelp Crab", depth_min = -98, depth_max =  0, temp_min = 7.8, temp_max =  12.8)
```

And there you have it! This is how I used spatial analysis tools in R to figure out where potential oyster (and any other species) aquaculture might be by EEZ along the west coast of the United States.
