## Hello world!

Out of the infinite amount of content that available on the web, you have stumbled upon a little screenshot of my life on a computer screen. Whoohoo! My name is Raymond (I go by Ray), and I created this personal website in R Studio to show off some of the things that are important to me in my academic and professional career. Here, I am sharing some skills, experiences, and hobbies that have molded me into the nature loving, data enthusiast that I am today.

With a diverse background in the "environmental" field, I have developed a passion for investigating environmental problems and applying data science skills to make sense of the chaos. Some of my favorite tools to use are R/RStudio, SQL, Tableau, QGIS, and of course, spreadsheets. I use these tools for everything from creating multi-species occupancy analyses of invasive rodents to visualizing anthropogenic energy production and consumption to simply analyzing my monthly budgeting.

I am currently completing my Masters in the 
[Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) 
at the University of California Santa Barbara, and I work as a teaching assistant on the side. When not grading tests or squinting my eyes at error messages, I enjoy getting after it outside.

Enjoy!
