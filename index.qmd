## Hello World!

<hr class="custom-line">

Out of the infinite amount of content on the web, you’ve stumbled upon a little snapshot of my life on a computer screen. Whoohoo! My name is Ray, and I created this personal website using Quarto to share a bit about who I am and what I do—including the skills, experiences, and hobbies that have shaped me into the nature-loving, data enthusiast I am today.

An Environmental Data Scientist by training, I currently work at [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/) researching the economy and health of West Coast fisheries. I hold a **Masters of Environmental Science and Management (MESM)** degree from the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) at UC Santa Barbara, as well as a **B.S.in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology**, and a **B.A. in Environmental Studies** from UC Santa Cruz. I enjoy various outdoor activities when not squinting my eyes at error messages. I also take on part-time, contract data-related gigs—so feel free to reach out if I can be of service!
