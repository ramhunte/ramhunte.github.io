## Hello World!

<hr class="custom-line">

Out of the infinite amount of content on the web, you’ve stumbled upon a little snapshot of my life. Whoohoo! My name is Ray, and I created this personal website using Quarto to share a bit about who I am and what I do. I am passionate about helping teams leverage programming tools (R, SQL, Shiny dashboards, GIS) to more efficiently tackle and understand their data. An Environmental Data Scientist by training, I currently work as a Data Analsyt at [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/) building Shiny applications and data pipelines to bring governemnt datasets to life. I hold a **Masters of Environmental Science and Management (MESM)** degree with a focus in Data Science from the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) at UC Santa Barbara. I enjoy various outdoor activities when not squinting my eyes at error messages.
