## Hello World!

Out of the infinite amount of content available on the web, you have stumbled upon a little screenshot of my life on a computer screen. Whoohoo! My name is Raymond (I go by Ray), and I created this personal website using Quarto in R Studio to show off some of the things that are important to me in my academic and professional career. Here, I am sharing some skills, experiences, and hobbies that have molded me into the nature loving, data enthusiast that I am today.

I have a graduate level background in Data Science, attaining my Masters of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) degree from the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) at UC Santa Barbara and degrees in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (B.S.) and Environmental Studies (B.A.) from UC Santa Cruz. While my work has been quite diverse, I am highly skilled in utilizing geospatial analysis and modeling to solve and understand environmental isses. Some of my favorite tools to use are R/RStudio, Python, SQL, and QGIS. I enjoy various outdoor activities when not squinting my eyes at error messages.

Enjoy!
