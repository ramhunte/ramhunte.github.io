    "text": "Hello world!\nOut of the infinite amount of content that available on the web, you have stumbled upon a little screenshot of my life on a computer screen. Whoohoo! My name is Raymond (I go by Ray), and I created this personal website in R Studio to show off some of the things that are important to me in my academic and professional career. Here, I am sharing some skills, experiences, and hobbies that have molded me into the nature loving, data enthusiast that I am today.\nWith a diverse background in the “environmental” field, I have developed a passion for investigating environmental problems and applying data science skills to make sense of the chaos. Some of my favorite tools to use are R/RStudio, SQL, Tableau, QGIS, and of course, spreadsheets. I use these tools for everything from creating multi-species occupancy analyses of invasive rodents to visualizing anthropogenic energy production and consumption to simply analyzing my monthly budgeting.\nI am currently completing my Masters in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California Santa Barbara, and I work as a teaching assistant on the side. When not grading tests or squinting my eyes at error messages, I enjoy getting after it outside.\nEnjoy!\n\n“Not all those who wonder are lost” - Gandalf the Grey"

    "text": "a snapshot of my life\n\n\n\nBioInterestsHobbies\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBorn and raised in Laguna Beach, CA, my admiration of the natural world was fostered in the blue waters of the Pacific ocean, where I frequently surfed and swam with the local inhabitants of the kelp forests. I started to venture out to the Sierra Nevada mountains where I learned to sit in in awe of its sharp granite and alpine lakes. Upon graduating high school, my connection to the environment brought me to northern California’s redwood forests where I attended the University of California, Santa Cruz. My education in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, as well as Environmental Studies, planted initial seed of what would become my career as a scientist.\nDuring my undergrad, I worked as lab and field techs doing whatever research jobs spoke to me at the time. One of my favorite experiences was camping out on a remote island in Baja California where I captured studies desert lizard and insect communities in cacti forests. I also worked quite a bit in Big Sur, analyzing the coastal California Steelhead communities and diets. And of course, I will never forget living in Puerto Rico for 3 months collecting microscopic protozoans in some harsh conditions. These experiences made me ever more curious, and were crucial in developing my skills in observing the natural world.\nUpon graduating in 3 years, I moved to Mammoth Lakes in 2021 to pursue rock climbing, skiing, backpacking, and working as a freshwater ecologist at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Center (SNARL). I frequented streams in the eastern Sierra doing field and lab work, with the goal of contributing to the scientific knowledge of benthic macroinvertebrate community ecology. I learned many of the skills that shape a successful scientist and make one really look at the world in a critical way. And I might have had a bit too much fun romping around in the mountains when he wasn’t working. My passion for learning drew me back to the coast in 2022 to start a masters program in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB where I remain today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField work in Big Sur, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField work in Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome beautiful microbes from Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding a desert iguana in Baja California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Data Science\n\nWhile I am passionate about a variety of environmental topics, one underlying theme keeps the gears in my mind spinning: Environmental Data Science. Grappling, extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data are ways that one can make sense of the world around them, and that is just what I like to do. I serves as the data manager for his masters group project working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) where my team and I are modeling the costs of various Puget Sound Chinook habitat restorations methods. I have also been working with The Nature Conservancy where I am strengthening their Channel Islands Biosecurity team.\nAside from his masters work, I am particularly interested in working with big data to extract meaningful patterns and insights on how we can improve the state of the environment. Sometimes this looks like modeling the occupancy of invasive rats in Southern California that serve as threats to endemic species. Other times it looks like predicting the effects of a carbon tax on consumer and supplier demand of goods. Regardless of the task, as long as it involves working with data and contributes to solving environmental problems, you will usually get my attention.\n\n\n\nIn my free time, . . .\n\nMy brain suffers immensely when he feels that he can’t get outside and move at the end of the day. Equally as strong as my love for nature is my desire to immerse myself in it. Some of my favorite activities include: rock climbing, surfing, paragliding, spearfishing, running, backpacking, and practicing yoga. While I know I can’t do them all every day, I try my best to at least one of them… or 3. Here are some of my favorite memories over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMountaineering trip up Matterhorn Peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for a multiday ascent up El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach day in Kauai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnack during a backcountry ski tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParagliding in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimbing Lone Pine Peak, California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamping in Big Sur"
