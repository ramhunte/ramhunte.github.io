    "text": "Introduction\nThe Sierra Nevada Mountains of California contain some of the nations most pristine wilderness, including thousands of lakes scattered throughout the range. Historically, the majority of these lakes were not inhabited with fish due to their fragmented and isolated nature, making it very difficult for fish to access lakes at high elevation. The Department of Fish and Game began to stock these lakes in the 20th century to promote recreational fishing in the range (R. Knapp 1996). While this provided many benefits to society, fish stocking posed many ecological threats to native species (R. Knapp 1996). These introduced trout (Rainbow, Brooke, Golden, Brown, Cutthroat, and hybrids) rely on zooplankton, a broad classifications of small organisms suspended in the water column that feed on phytoplankton and microbes, as a main food source in their fry stage of life (MacLennan, Dings-Avery, and Vinebrooke 2015).\nThis study aims to understand the abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living) factors that influence zooplankton community dynamics in the High Sierra. The questions being asked are:\n1) How does the size and elevation of lakes affect the diversity and richness of zooplankton communities?\n2) Does the presence of fish influence the diversity and richness of zooplankton in these lakes?\nI used multiple linear regression models to understand if and how diversity and richness were being affected by these variables. Because previous literature suggests that lakes support smaller foodwebs with decreasing size (Post, Pace, and Hairston 2000) and become more oligotrophic (less nutrient input) with increasing elevation (Sadro, Nelson, and Melack 2012), I hypothesized that the diversity and richness of zooplankton communities would lessen as lake size decreases and elevation increases. Furthermore, the presence of fish will present selective predation on certain zooplankton species, altering species diversity and richness as well.\n\n\ncode\n# map of the sierra nevada mountains\nmap &lt;- ggmap(basemap) +\n    geom_sf(data = snb, color = \"black\",  fill = \"lightblue4\", alpha = .4, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n   labs(title = \"The Sierra Nevada Mountains\", x = \"\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n     annotation_scale(location = \"bl\",\n                      pad_y = unit(0.4, \"in\")) +\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"bl\",\n                         pad_x = unit(0.3, \"in\"),\n                         pad_y = unit(0.8, \"in\"),\n                         height = unit(.4, \"in\"),\n                           width = unit(.3, \"in\"),\n                         size = 5)\nmap\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Methods\nOver 1,100 lakes were surveyed from 1995-2002 as a part of the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP), with the goal of describing the biodiversity of lentic water bodies in lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows in the Southern Sierra (R. A. Knapp et al., n.d.). All study observation and samples were collected between months of July and September. Area and elevation of the lakes were calculated using GPS and GIS for lakes where area was unknown. Fish presence was measured using both visual and net surveys at the edge of lakes to identify species presence. Zooplankton samples were collected in water samples that were then packed out and identified in the lab at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) in Mammoth Lakes, California. Due to the varying stages of maturity and small sizes of zooplankton, taxon were sometimes identified to genus, family, or life stage if not able to be identified to species level. Zooplankton samples were originally collected in 3 different subsamples, so diversity was averaged for all 3 lake subsamples to calculate each lake’s Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Species richness was calculated by identifying unique taxon across all 3 samples. Zooplankton data was not collected in 1998, 1999, or 2002."

    "text": "Results\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nBefore doing any modeling, I wanted to visualize and explore the data a bit to understand how it was distributed. A histogram of the log lake area returned a relatively normally distributed curve with a short right tail, suggesting that medium to larger lakes were more frequently observed than small ones (fig.2.A). Distributions appeared to be similar regardless of fish presence. A histogram of lake elevation showed less of a normal distribution with a long left tail, indicating that the majority of lakes observed were at higher elevations (fig.2.B). Regardless of fish presence, the shape of the curve still resembles somewhat of a normal unimodal shape despite the long tail.\nNote:Log area is used in this study as the area had a skewed distribution, and the log transformation suited the data better for linear modeling.\n\n\ncode\n# making histograms of area and elevation\n\nh1 &lt;- ggplot(data = total , aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr),  fill = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"black\", size = .1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2))\n\nh2 &lt;- ggplot(data = total , aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, fill = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"black\", size = .1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"\")\n\nhist &lt;- h1 + h2 +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\",\n              heights = 5) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nhist \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

I examined a simple scatterplot to visually inspect for a possible relationship between log lake area and elevation, both with and without fish present (fig.3). While fish seemed to be more frequent in larger lakes and observations were clustered slightly clustered at high elevation, the data points appeared to be scattered and noisy with little evidence of a significant relationship. The correlation between log lake area and elevation was minimal so I kept both independent variables in consideration through the study (r = 0.03.\n\n\ncode\n#making scatterplots with independent variables\n\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(total, aes(y = log(lake_area_nbr), x = lake_elevation_nbr, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .7) + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2) ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\nscatter\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

The correlation was positive and weaker for species diversity and log lake area when fish were absent compared to present (r = 0.11, r = 0.33) (fig.4.A). Similar results occured for species richness and log lake area (r = 0.05, r = 0.36) (fig.4.B). Diversity and richness in lakes were strongly and negatively correlated with with elevation, and the presence of fish did not change the correlation strength noticeably (r = -0.44, r = -0.45) (fig.4.C). Stronger negative relationships were found between species richness and elevation both with and without fish (r = -0.55, r = -0.53) (fig.4.D).\n\n\ncode\n# diversity log lake area\nda &lt;- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr), y = mean_div, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2), y = \"Mean Diversity\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# diversity log lake elevation\nde &lt;- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, y = mean_div, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"Mean Diversity\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .075,\n            label.y.npc = .25,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# richness log lake area\nra&lt;- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr), y = richness, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2), y = \"Richness\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# diversity log lake elevation\nre &lt;- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, y =richness, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"Richness\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n#combined correlations figure\ncorrelations &lt;- (da + ra)/(de + re) + \n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\",\n              heights = 5) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n# & ylab(NULL) & theme(plot.margin = margin(6.5, 5.5, 0, 5.5)) \n\ncorrelations\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

I tested these initial observed patterns by modeling zooplankton species diversity and richness as a function of the following explanatory variables: log lake area, lake elevation, fish presence, interaction of log lake area x fish presence (eda hinted at a potential effect as seen in the difference of slopes in fig.2.A and fig.2.B), and the addition of a temporal component (year) to see if these community dynamic patterns changed aver time. The goal of these models were to test the strength of the predictor variables in explaining the variation in zooplankton diversity and richness and to also test if these variable were statistically significance (\\(\\alpha\\) = .05).\n\\[diversity_i=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot log(area)_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot elevation_i + \\beta_{3} \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{4} \\cdot log(area)_i \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{5} \\cdot year_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]\n\\[richness_i=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot log(area)_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot elevation_i + \\beta_{3} \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{4} \\cdot log(area)_i \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{5} \\cdot year_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]\nThe species diversity model results conclude that the log area (positively) and lake elevation (negatively) significantly affected zooplankton species diversity (p &lt; .05, p &lt; .001). While lakes with fish present reduced zooplankton diversity, no significance was found (P &gt; .05). Similarly, the interaction between log lake area and fish presence was insignificant but positively affected diversity (more so than lakes without fish) (p = .14). No individual year had a significant effect on species diversity.\nThe species richness model also showed that the log lake area (positively) and lake elevation (negatively) significantly affected zooplankton richness (p &lt; .05, p &lt; .001). Unlike the diversity model, species richness was significantly and negatively affected by the presence of fish in lakes (p &lt; 0.05). The interaction between log lake area and fish presence also was a significant factor in affecting species richness, indicating that the size of the lake affected zooplankton richness differently depending on whether fish were present or not (p &lt; .05). No individual year had a significant effect on species richness.\n\n\ncode\n#diversity model \nm_div &lt;- lm(mean_div ~ log(lake_area_nbr) + lake_elevation_nbr + actual_fish_presence + log(lake_area_nbr):actual_fish_presence + year, data = total)\n# m_div_sum &lt;- summary(m_div)\n\n\n#richness model\nm_rich &lt;- lm(richness ~ log(lake_area_nbr) + lake_elevation_nbr + actual_fish_presence + log(lake_area_nbr):actual_fish_presence +  year, data = total)\n# summary(m_rich)\n\n#creatign a table \ntab_model(m_div, m_rich,\n          pred.labels = c(\"Intercept\", \"log Area\", \"Elevation\",\n                          \"Fish Presence(Yes)\", \"1997\",\n                          \"2000\", \"2001\",\n                          \"log Area x Fish Presence(Yes)\"),\n          dv.labels = c(\"Divsersity\", \"Richness\"),\n          string.ci = \"Conf.

    "text": "Discussion\nZooplankton species diversity and richness are closely related, and they both responded similarly to abiotic conditions (log lake area and lake elevation). (Urmy and Warren 2019) also showed that zooplankton species responded noticeably across elevation even at a fine scale. However, species richness was noticeably lower in lakes with fish present compared to without when holding lake area and elevation constant, indicating that biotic factors (fish present) alter the ability of specific zooplankton species to persist (likely due to taxa specific predation).\nThe most interesting finding from these results is that the area of a lake affects the zooplankton species richness noticeably more when fish are present as seen in the interaction coefficient of the richness model. Richness is very low in small lakes and very high in large lakes when fish are present (steep positive slope), whereas richness is moderate to high in lakes without fish (moderate positive slope). Other studies have found similar results where the effects of fish predation on zooplankton are amplified by varying environmental conditions (MacLennan, Dings-Avery, and Vinebrooke 2015). This begs the question: Why are zooplankton more sensitive to changes in lake area when fish are present vs absent? This question can be answered by the ecological principle known as the Island Biogeography Theory which states that prey on smaller islands (or habitats) experience more intense predation pressure from predators than on larger islands (MacArthur and Wilson 2001). Due to their isolation and limited resources, zoo plankton in small lakes experience higher extinction rates from concetrated predation, less resources (nutrient input), and lower emigration . This applies quite literally into our study system here were introduced fish in small lakes (islands) suppress zooplankton species richness (prey) more intensely than in larger lakes (islands). Similar patterns have also been observed across taxa in lakes across North America (Browne 1981).\nThis study did not include a spatial element as coordinates were not provided in the data as a measure to keep sensitive and rare fish lakes discreet. Future research should look at other taxa in oligotrophic alpine lake food webs (algae, microbes, benthic macroinvertebrates) to understand potential trophic cascades and community wide effects of fish introduction."

    "text": "Hello world!\nOut of the infinite amount of content available on the web, you have stumbled upon a little screenshot of my life on a computer screen. Whoohoo! My name is Raymond (I go by Ray), and I created this personal website using Quarto in R Studio to show off some of the things that are important to me in my academic and professional career. Here, I am sharing some skills, experiences, and hobbies that have molded me into the nature loving, data enthusiast that I am today.\nWith a diverse background in the “environmental” field, I have developed a passion for investigating environmental problems and applying data science skills to make sense of the chaos. Some of my favorite tools to use are R/RStudio, SQL, Tableau, QGIS, and of course, spreadsheets. I use these tools for everything from creating multi-species occupancy analyses of invasive rodents to visualizing anthropogenic energy production and consumption to simply analyzing my monthly budgeting.\nI am currently completing my Masters in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California Santa Barbara, and I work as a teaching assistant on the side. When not grading tests or squinting my eyes at error messages, I enjoy getting after it outside.\nEnjoy!\n\n“Not all those who wonder are lost” - Gandalf the Grey"

    "text": "a snapshot of my life\n\n\n\nBioInterestsHobbies\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nBorn and raised in Laguna Beach, CA, my admiration of the natural world was fostered in the blue waters of the Pacific ocean, where I frequently surfed and swam with the local inhabitants of the kelp forests. I started to venture out to the Sierra Nevada mountains where I learned to sit in in awe of its sharp granite and alpine lakes. Upon graduating high school, my connection to the environment brought me to northern California’s redwood forests where I attended the University of California, Santa Cruz. My education in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, as well as Environmental Studies, planted initial seed of what would become my career as a scientist.\nDuring my undergrad, I worked as lab and field techs doing whatever research jobs spoke to me at the time. One of my favorite experiences was camping out on a remote island in Baja California where I studied desert lizard and insect communities in cacti forests. I also worked quite a bit in Big Sur, analyzing the coastal California Steelhead communities and diets. And of course, I will never forget living in Puerto Rico for 3 months collecting microscopic protozoans in some harsh conditions. These experiences made me ever more curious, and were crucial in developing my skills in observing the natural world.\nUpon graduating in 3 years, I moved to Mammoth Lakes in 2021 to pursue rock climbing, skiing, backpacking, and working as a freshwater ecologist at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Center (SNARL). I frequented streams in the eastern Sierra doing field and lab work, with the goal of contributing to the scientific knowledge of benthic macroinvertebrate community ecology. I learned many of the skills that shape a successful scientist and make one really look at the world in a critical way. And I might have had a bit too much fun romping around in the mountains when he wasn’t working. My passion for learning drew me back to the coast in 2022 to start a masters program in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB where I remain today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField work in Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding a desert iguana in Baja California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome beautiful microbes from Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField work in Big Sur, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling a rock glacier stream in the Sierras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking in the lab at UCSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Data Science\n\nWhile I am passionate about a variety of environmental topics, one underlying theme keeps the gears in my mind spinning: Environmental Data Science. Grappling, extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data are ways that one can make sense of the world around them, and that is just what I like to do. I serves as the data manager for his masters group project working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) where my team and I are modeling the costs of various Puget Sound Chinook habitat restorations methods. I have also been working with The Nature Conservancy where I am strengthening their Channel Islands Biosecurity team.\nAside from my masters work, I am particularly interested in working with big data to extract meaningful patterns and insights on how we can improve the state of the environment. Sometimes this looks like modeling the occupancy of invasive rats in Southern California that serve as threats to endemic species. Other times it looks like predicting the effects of a carbon tax on consumer and supplier demand of goods. Regardless of the task, as long as it involves working with data and contributes to solving environmental problems, you will usually get my attention.\n\n\n\nIn my free time . . .\n\nEqually as strong as my love for nature is my desire to immerse myself in it. Some of my favorite activities include: rock climbing, surfing, paragliding, spearfishing, running, backpacking, and practicing yoga. While I know I can’t do them all every day, I try my best to at least one of them… or 3. Here are some of my favorite memories over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMountaineering trip up Matterhorn Peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for a multiday ascent up El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig wall climbing on El Capitan, Yosemite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnack during a backcountry ski tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach day in Kauai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParagliding in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimbing Lone Pine Peak, California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamping in Big Sur"
