Historically, the majority of these lakes were not inhabited with fish due to their fragmented and isolated nature, making it very difficult for fish to access lakes at high elevation. The Department of Fish and Game began to stock these lakes in the 20th century to promote recreational fishing in the range [@knapp1996]. While this provided many benefits to society, fish stocking posed many ecological threats to native species [@knapp1996]. These introduced trout (Rainbow, Brooke, Golden, Brown, Cutthroat, and hybrids) rely on zooplankton, a broad classifications of small organisms suspended in the water column that feed on phytoplankton and microbes, as a main food source in their fry stage of life [@maclennan2015].\n\nThis study aims to understand the abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living) factors that influence zooplankton community dynamics in the High Sierra. The questions being asked are:\n\n**1) How does the size and elevation of lakes affect the diversity and richness of zooplankton communities?**\n\n**2) Does the presence of fish influence the diversity and richness of zooplankton in these lakes?**\n\nI used multiple linear regression models to understand if and how diversity and richness were being affected by these variables. Because previous literature suggests that lakes support smaller foodwebs with decreasing size [@post2000] and become more oligotrophic (less nutrient input) with increasing elevation [@sadro2012], I hypothesized that the diversity and richness of zooplankton communities would lessen as lake size decreases and elevation increases. Furthermore, the presence of fish will present selective predation on certain zooplankton species, altering species diversity and richness as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# map of the sierra nevada mountains\nmap <- ggmap(basemap) +\n    geom_sf(data = snb, color = \"black\",  fill = \"lightblue4\", alpha = .4, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n   labs(title = \"The Sierra Nevada Mountains\", x = \"\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n     annotation_scale(location = \"bl\",\n                      pad_y = unit(0.4, \"in\")) +\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"bl\",\n                         pad_x = unit(0.3, \"in\"),\n                         pad_y = unit(0.8, \"in\"),\n                         height = unit(.4, \"in\"),\n                           width = unit(.3, \"in\"),\n                         size = 5)\nmap\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 1.** Map of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range in California.

All study observation and samples were collected between months of July and September. Area and elevation of the lakes were calculated using GPS and GIS for lakes where area was unknown. Fish presence was measured using both visual and net surveys at the edge of lakes to identify species presence. Zooplankton samples were collected in water samples that were then packed out and identified in the lab at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) in Mammoth Lakes, California. Due to the varying stages of maturity and small sizes of zooplankton, taxon were sometimes identified to genus, family, or life stage if not able to be identified to species level. Zooplankton samples were originally collected in 3 different subsamples, so diversity was averaged for all 3 lake subsamples to calculate each lake's Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Species richness was calculated by identifying unique taxon across all 3 samples. Zooplankton data was not collected in 1998, 1999, or 2002.\n\n## Results\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nBefore doing any modeling, I wanted to visualize and explore the data a bit to understand how it was distributed. A histogram of the log lake area returned a relatively normally distributed curve with a short right tail, suggesting that medium to larger lakes were more frequently observed than small ones (fig.2.A). Distributions appeared to be similar regardless of fish presence. A histogram of lake elevation showed less of a normal distribution with a long left tail, indicating that the majority of lakes observed were at higher elevations (fig.2.B). Regardless of fish presence, the shape of the curve still resembles somewhat of a normal unimodal shape despite the long tail.\n\n*Note:Log area is used in this study as the area had a skewed distribution, and the log transformation suited the data better for linear modeling.*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# making histograms of area and elevation\n\nh1 <- ggplot(data = total , aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr),  fill = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"black\", size = .1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2))\n\nh2 <- ggplot(data = total , aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, fill = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"black\", size = .1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"\")\n\nhist <- h1 + h2 +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\",\n              heights = 5) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nhist \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 2.

I examined a simple scatterplot to visually inspect for a possible relationship between log lake area and elevation, both with and without fish present (fig.3). While fish seemed to be more frequent in larger lakes and observations were clustered slightly clustered at high elevation, the data points appeared to be scattered and noisy with little evidence of a significant relationship. The correlation between log lake area and elevation was minimal so I kept both independent variables in consideration through the study (r = 0.03.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#making scatterplots with independent variables\n\nscatter <- ggplot(total, aes(y = log(lake_area_nbr), x = lake_elevation_nbr, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .7) + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2) ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\nscatter\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 3.** Scatterplot showing relationship of log lake area and lake elevation.

Similar results occured for species richness and log lake area (r = 0.05, r = 0.36) (fig.4.B). Diversity and richness in lakes were strongly and negatively correlated with with elevation, and the presence of fish did not change the correlation strength noticeably (r = -0.44, r = -0.45) (fig.4.C). Stronger negative relationships were found between species richness and elevation both with and without fish (r = -0.55, r = -0.53) (fig.4.D).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# diversity log lake area\nda <- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr), y = mean_div, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2), y = \"Mean Diversity\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# diversity log lake elevation\nde <- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, y = mean_div, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"Mean Diversity\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .075,\n            label.y.npc = .25,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# richness log lake area\nra<- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = log(lake_area_nbr), y = richness, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = expression(\"log Lake Area m\"^2), y = \"Richness\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n# diversity log lake elevation\nre <- ggplot(data = total, aes(x = lake_elevation_nbr, y =richness, color = actual_fish_presence)) +\n  labs(x = \"Lake Elevation (m)\", y = \"Richness\") + \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\", se = T, lwd = 0.8) +\n  theme_classic() + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Fish Present \", values = c(\"lightblue4\", \"cyan3\")) +\n  stat_cor(aes(label = ..r.label..),\n           r.accuracy = 0.01,\n           label.x.npc = .01,\n            label.y.npc = 1,\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           size = 2.5)\n\n#combined correlations figure\ncorrelations <- (da + ra)/(de + re) + \n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\",\n              heights = 5) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n# & ylab(NULL) & theme(plot.margin = margin(6.5, 5.5, 0, 5.5)) \n\ncorrelations\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 4.

I tested these initial observed patterns by modeling zooplankton species diversity and richness as a function of the following explanatory variables: log lake area, lake elevation, fish presence, interaction of log lake area x fish presence (eda hinted at a potential effect as seen in the difference of slopes in **fig.2.A** and **fig.2.B**), and the addition of a temporal component (year) to see if these community dynamic patterns changed aver time. The goal of these models were to test the strength of the predictor variables in explaining the variation in zooplankton diversity and richness and to also test if these variable were statistically significance ($\\alpha$ = .05).\n\n$$diversity_i=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot log(area)_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot elevation_i + \\beta_{3} \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{4} \\cdot log(area)_i \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{5} \\cdot year_i + \\varepsilon_i$$\n\n$$richness_i=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\cdot log(area)_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot elevation_i + \\beta_{3} \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{4} \\cdot log(area)_i \\cdot fish_i + \\beta_{5} \\cdot year_i + \\varepsilon_i$$\n\nThe species diversity model results conclude that the log area (positively) and lake elevation (negatively) significantly affected zooplankton species diversity (p \\< .05, p \\< .001). While lakes with fish present reduced zooplankton diversity, no significance was found (p \\> .05). Similarly, the interaction between log lake area and fish presence was insignificant but positively affected diversity (more so than lakes without fish) (p = .14). No individual year had a significant effect on species diversity.\n\nThe species richness model also showed that the log lake area (positively) and lake elevation (negatively) significantly affected zooplankton richness (p \\< .05, p \\< .001). Unlike the diversity model, species richness was significantly and negatively affected by the presence of fish in lakes (p \\< 0.05). The interaction between log lake area and fish presence also was a significant factor in affecting species richness, indicating that the size of the lake affected zooplankton richness differently depending on whether fish were present or not (p \\< .05). No individual year had a significant effect on species richness.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#diversity model \nm_div <- lm(mean_div ~ log(lake_area_nbr) + lake_elevation_nbr + actual_fish_presence + log(lake_area_nbr):actual_fish_presence + year, data = total)\n# m_div_sum <- summary(m_div)\n\n\n#richness model\nm_rich <- lm(richness ~ log(lake_area_nbr) + lake_elevation_nbr + actual_fish_presence + log(lake_area_nbr):actual_fish_presence +  year, data = total)\n# summary(m_rich)\n\n#creatign a table \ntab_model(m_div, m_rich,\n          pred.labels = c(\"Intercept\", \"log Area\", \"Elevation\",\n                          \"Fish Presence(Yes)\", \"1997\",\n                          \"2000\", \"2001\",\n                          \"log Area x Fish Presence(Yes)\"),\n          dv.labels = c(\"Divsersity\", \"Richness\"),\n          string.ci = \"Conf.

As seen in the plots, the residuals for both models fit the normal distribution quite well, with the exception of a slight and minor deviation in the tails. This implies that the diversity model residuals have a slight negative skew (fig.5.A), and the richness model has slightly fatter than expected tails (fig.5.B). In conclusion, the QQ plots imply assumptions of normality are met.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#diversity model residuals\nm_div_res <- residuals(m_div)\n#richness model residuals\nm_rich_res <- residuals(m_rich)\n\n#qq plot for diversity \ndiv_qq <-  ggplot( m_div, aes(sample = .resid)) +\n  geom_qq(color = \"lightblue4\") +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs( x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\", y = \"Sample Quantiles\")\n\n#qq plot for richness\nrich_qq <-  ggplot( m_rich, aes(sample = .resid)) +\n  geom_qq(color = \"lightblue4\") +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs( x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\", y = \"\")\n\n#joining plots\nqq <- div_qq + rich_qq +\nplot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\") \n\nqq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 5.

[@urmy2019] also showed that zooplankton species responded noticeably across elevation even at a fine scale. However, species richness was noticeably lower in lakes with fish present compared to without when holding lake area and elevation constant, indicating that biotic factors (fish present) alter the ability of specific zooplankton species to persist (likely due to taxa specific predation).\n\nThe most interesting finding from these results is that the area of a lake affects the zooplankton species richness noticeably more when fish are present as seen in the interaction coefficient of the richness model. Richness is very low in small lakes and very high in large lakes when fish are present (steep positive slope), whereas richness is moderate to high in lakes without fish (moderate positive slope). Other studies have found similar results where the effects of fish predation on zooplankton are amplified by varying environmental conditions [@maclennan2015]. This begs the question: **Why are zooplankton more sensitive to changes in lake area when fish are present vs absent?** This question can be answered by the ecological principle known as the *Island Biogeography Theory* which states that prey on smaller islands (or habitats) experience more intense predation pressure from predators than on larger islands [@macarthur2001]. Due to their isolation and limited resources, zoo plankton in small lakes experience higher extinction rates from concetrated predation, less resources (nutrient input), and lower emigration . This applies quite literally into our study system here were introduced fish in small lakes (islands) suppress zooplankton species richness (prey) more intensely than in larger lakes (islands). Similar patterns have also been observed across taxa in lakes across North America [@browne1981].\n\nThis study did not include a spatial element as coordinates were not provided in the data as a measure to keep sensitive and rare fish lakes discreet. Future research should look at other taxa in oligotrophic alpine lake food webs (algae, microbes, benthic macroinvertebrates) to understand potential trophic cascades and community wide effects of fish introduction.\n",
