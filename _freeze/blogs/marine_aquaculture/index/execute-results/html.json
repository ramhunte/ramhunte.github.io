As society progresses further into uncharted waters with climate change, it is critical that we explore alternative options to mitigate GHG emissions. Marine aquaculture is an important practice that has a high potential to transform the way the global food supply operates as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production.[^1]  One important study by [Gentry et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9) mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth .[^2] This highlighted the true potential of the industry, although it is still far from reaching its capacity. \n\n[^1]: Hall, S.

In this analysis, I am looking at how to identify potential marine species habitat suitable for aquaculture along the West Coast of the United States in each of its Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). I specifically look at habitat requirements across temperature and depth requirements for oysters (a widely commercially available food source) and then create a function from this analysis that can be applied to any west coast species with a given temperature and depth range and potential for aquaculture. This analysis utilizes a variety of spatial analysis tools to for both vector and raster data. These include:\n\n-  spatial subsetting and joins\n-  raster reclassifiaction\n-  rasterization and vectorization of spatial data\n-  cropping and masking layers\n-  zonal statistics\n-  transforming CRS\n-  utilizing periodic checks\n\n## Approach\n\nBased on previous research, we know that oysters need the following\nconditions in order to reach optimal growth rates:\n-   sea surface temperature: 11-30Â°C\n-   depth: 0-70 meters below sea level\n\nI used raster and vector data and spatial analysis tools to identify where these ranges overlapped to isolate suitable habitat.\nFollowing these steps, I created maps visualizing priority EEZ's depending on their total and percent suitable aquaculture habitat. I applied this methodology into a function that reproduces the same workflow to find suitable habita for any species with a temperature and depth range that could be potentially grown along the west coast.\n\n### Data\n\n#### Sea Surface Temperature\n\nAverage annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years\n2008 to 2012 was used to characterize the average sea surface temperature within the region. The data was originally generated from\n[NOAA's 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly\nv3.1](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php).\n\n#### Bathymetry\n\nTo characterize the depth of the ocean I used the [General\nBathymetric Chart of the Oceans\n(GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area).[^3]\n\n[^3]: GEBCO Compilation Group (2022) GEBCO_2022 Grid\n    (<doi:10.5285/e0f0bb80-ab44-2739-e053-6c86abc0289c>).\n\n#### Exclusive Economic Zones\n\nMaritime boundaries were designated using Exclusive Economic\nZones off of the west coast of US from\n[Marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php). \n\n## Analysis\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n#### Prepare data \n\nTo start, I loaded in and organized all necessary data and made sure it had the correct coordinate reference system. This involved:\n\n-   reading in the shapefile for the West Coast EEZ\n    (`wc_regions_clean.shp`)\\\n-   reading in SST raster data\n    -   `average_annual_sst_2008.tif`\\\n    -   `average_annual_sst_2009.tif`\\\n    -   `average_annual_sst_2010.tif`\\\n    -   `average_annual_sst_2011.tif`\\\n    -   `average_annual_sst_2012.tif`\\\n-   combining SST rasters into a raster stack\n-   reading in bathymetry raster (`depth.tif`)\\\n-   checking that data are in the same coordinate reference system\\\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#loading in and preparing the data in raster format \n\n# reading in west coast eez shape file \neez <- st_read(file.path(data, \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"))\n\n#read in SST raster data as a stack\nstack <- rast(c(file.path(data, \"average_annual_sst_2008.tif\"), \n                file.path(data, \"average_annual_sst_2009.tif\"), \n                file.path(data, \"average_annual_sst_2010.tif\"), \n                file.path(data, \"average_annual_sst_2011.tif\"), \n                file.path(data, \"average_annual_sst_2012.tif\")))\n\n#changing CRS\nstack <- project(stack, \"epsg:4326\")\n\n#read in bathymetry data \nbath <- rast(file.path(data, \"depth.tif\"))\n\n# plot(stack)\n# plot(bath)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Process data \n\nNext, I processed the SST and depth data so that they could be\ncombined. In this case the SST and depth data had slightly different\nresolutions, extents, and positions. Because I didn't want to change the\nunderlying depth data, I resampled to match the SST data\nusing the nearest neighbor approach.\n\nThe steps I took can be summarized as follows:\n\n-   Step 1: find the mean SST from 2008-2012\\\n-   Step 2: convert SST data from Kelvin to Celsius\\\n-   Step 3: crop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster (match CRS first)\n-   Step 4: resample the NPP data to match the resolution of the SST datausing the nearest neighbor approach\\\n-   Step 5: check that the depth and SST match in resolution, extent, and\n    coordinate reference system\\\n\nI then created a check to ensure that the extent, resolution, and CRS of bathymetry and temperature raster layers matched.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# finding mean temperature raster data in celsius and aligning resolutions and extents of rasters\n\n#findig mean of sst rasters\nmean_sst <- mean(stack)\n# plot(mean_sst)\n\n#finding temp in celsius\ncels_sst <- mean_sst - 273.15\n\n#cropping depth raster to sst\ncrop_bath <- crop(bath, cels_sst)\n# plot(crop_bath)\n\n#resampling bath layer to match resolution of celsius\nresamp_bath <- resample(crop_bath, cels_sst, method = \"near\")\n\n# plot(reclass_bath)\n\n                  ####### creating a check #######\ncat(\"Extent, resolution, and CRS of bathymetry and temprature raster layers match:\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nExtent, resolution, and CRS of bathymetry and temprature raster layers match:\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(ext(resamp_bath) == ext(cels_sst) & \n   st_crs(resamp_bath)$epsg == st_crs(cels_sst)$epsg &\n   # resolution has more than one responses, so we need to make sure that both are true \n   all(res(resamp_bath) == res(cels_sst))) {\n  cat(\"TRUE\")\n} else{\n  cat(\"FALSE\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Finding suitable locations \n\nIn order to find suitable locations for marine aquaculture, I first needed\nto find locations that were suitable in terms of both SST and depth. This involved reclassifying the SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for Oysters by assigning a `1` or a `NA` value to suitable and unsuitable habitats. I then multiplied the two rasters to look for locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions (raster cells where `1` values overlapped) using the `lapp()` function. Lastly, I created a check to ensure that the masked ideal layer only showed overlapping ideal depth and temperature conditions.\n \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#reclassifying temperature and bathymetry raster data, and then overlaying the layers to find ideal habitat \n\n\n# reclassify temp raster to NA or 1 if in 11-30C temp range \nrcl_temp <- classify(cels_sst, rcl = \n                      matrix(c(-Inf, 11, NA, \n                      11, 30, 1, \n                      30, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))\n# plot(rcl_temp)\n\n# reclassify bathymetry data (0-70 meters below sea level)\nrcl_bath <- classify(resamp_bath, rcl = \n                      matrix(c(-Inf, -70, NA, \n                      -70, 0, 1, \n                      0, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))\n# plot(rcl_bath)\n\n#creating a raster stack\nideal_stack <- c(rcl_temp, rcl_bath)\n\n#renaming rasters in stack\nnames(ideal_stack) <- c(\"temperature\", \"depth\")\n\n#creating a multiplication function \nmultiply <- function(x,y){\n  return(x*y)\n}\n\n# multiplying layers to get just cells = 1 (ideal depth and temp )\nideal_layer <- lapp(ideal_stack[[c(1,2)]], fun = multiply)\n\n# plot(ideal_layer)\n\n              ################### Check ###############\n#checking to make sure ideal layer is only showing areas where the temp and depth are in ideal range\ncat(\"Masked ideal layer only shows overlapping ideal depth and temperature conditons:\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nMasked ideal layer only shows overlapping ideal depth and temperature conditons:\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(all(\n  values(ideal_layer == 1) == values(ideal_stack[[1]] == 1),\n  values(ideal_layer == 1) == values(ideal_stack[[2]] == 1), na.rm = TRUE)) {\n  cat(\"TRUE\")\n} else{\n  cat(\"FALSE\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Determine the most suitable EEZ \n\nI first needed to determine the total suitable area within each EEZ in order to\nrank zones by priority. To do so, I found the total area of\nsuitable locations within each EEZ. The steps in which I approached this can be summarized as such:\n\n-   Step 1: read in, rasterize, and crop the the eez data to the extent and resolution of the ideal habitat layer\n-   Step 2: calculate the size of each raster cell in km^2\n-   Step 3: sum the tala area of suitable habitat cells using `zonal()` function\n-   Step 4: join this data with the eez data and create new columns with the total eez area, the toal suitable habitat in each eez, and the percent suitable habitat by eez\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#here we are calculating the total area of suitable habitat and the percent area of suitable habitat for each EEZ\n\n#read in EEZ data \neez <- st_read(file.path(data, \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"))\n\n#rasterizing polygon data with ideal locations by region and masking it to ideal locations\neez_mask <- rasterize(eez, ideal_layer, field = \"rgn\") %>% \n  terra::crop(ideal_layer, mask = TRUE)\n# plot(eez_mask)\n\n#find area of raster cells \ncell_area <- cellSize(eez_mask, unit = \"km\")\n# plot(cell_area)\n\n#calculate the total area of km2 by region\nideal_area <- zonal(cell_area, eez_mask, fun = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#joining ideal area data w/ eez vector data \njoined_eez <- left_join(eez, \n            ideal_area, \n            by = \"rgn\") %>% \n  mutate(ideal_area_km2 = area, \n         perc_ideal = (ideal_area_km2/area_km2)*100, \n         .before = geometry)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Visualize results \n\nFinally, I created two maps showing 1) the total suitable oyster aquaculture habitat area by region, and 2) the percent suitable oyster aquaculture habitat area by region:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# pulling in states/base map layer for mapping EEZ's\nstates <- us_states\n\n#choosing just the west coast regions\nwest_coast <- st_sf(us_states) %>% \n  filter(REGION == \"West\") %>% \n  st_transform(crs = st_crs(joined_eez))\n\n\n#plotting the percent suitable area of ideal habitat for oysters for each EEZ\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = west_coast, color = \"black\", fill = \"#E4CA74\") +\n  geom_sf(data = joined_eez, aes(fill = perc_ideal)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(title = \"% Suitable Oyster Aquaculture Habitat of West \\nCoast Exclusive Economic Zones in the US\", y = \"Longitude\", x = \"Latitude\", fill = expression(\"% Suitable Area\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue3\"), \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) +\n    # panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n   # panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n     coord_sf(xlim = c(-132.5, -114.5)) +\n   annotation_scale( location = \"bl\") +\n  # theme( legend.position= \"bottom\") +\n         # plot.margin=unit(c(1,6,.5,1),\"cm\")) +\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"bl\",\n                         pad_x = unit(0.05, \"in\"),\n                         pad_y = unit(0.3, \"in\"),\n                         style = ggspatial::north_arrow_minimal()) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -121, y = 32.5, label = \"Southern CA\", size = 2, color = \"black\") +\n   annotate(\"text\", x = -124, y = 36, label = \"Central CA\", size = 2, color = \"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -126.5, y = 40, label = \"Northern CA\", size = 2, color = \"lightgrey\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -126.5, y = 44, label = \"Oregon\", size = 2, color = \"lightgrey\") +\n      annotate(\"text\", x = -126.5, y = 46.7, label = \"Washington\", size = 2, color = \"black\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Figure 1. % Suitable Oyster Aquaculture Habitat of \nWest Coast Exclusive Economic Zones in the US**.
